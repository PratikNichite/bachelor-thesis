# Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System

A machine learning-based system designed to detect and prevent drowsiness in drivers in real-time. By using facial feature detection via a mobile camera, the system tracks eye movements and head posture to assess drowsiness. If detected, an alert is triggered using an Arduino Nano-controlled buzzer. The system ensures enhanced road safety by reducing accidents caused by driver fatigue.

## Features
- Real-time facial and eye tracking using **Mobile Vision API**.
- Drowsiness detection based on eye closure duration.
- Alerts through hardware integration:
  - **Arduino Nano**
  - **Piezo Buzzer**
  - **Bluetooth Module (HC-05)**
- User-friendly **Android interface**.
- High accuracy under optimal lighting conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Java, Arduino IDE.
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Mobile Vision API.
- **Hardware**: Arduino Nano, Bluetooth HC-05, Piezo Buzzer.

## Future Scope
- Integration into embedded systems for automobiles.
- Improved performance under low-light conditions.
- Expanded applications for other scenarios like monitoring fatigue in operators.
